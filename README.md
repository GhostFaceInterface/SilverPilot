# SilverPilot

SilverPilot is a paper-trading and analysis system for silver scenarios using a virtual 600 USD starting balance.

## Scope

- No real-money trading.
- No bank automation.
- No live buy/sell execution.
- Data first, simulation second, risk policy third, LLM agents later, ML last.

## Current Phase

Phase 0 is complete at skeleton and documentation-discipline level. Phase 1 has not started.

- `/health` endpoint.
- basic tests.
